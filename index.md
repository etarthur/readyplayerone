# Computing Technology

## Virtual Reality
https://www.copperberg.com/mika-karaila-discusses-virtual-reality/

### Technology:
Current:
  Virtual Reality technology is a growing phenomenon currently gated by the requirement of a moderately strong pc [E1]. The following specs are required to run oculus VR on “minimum settings”: Nvidia GTX 970, Intel i5-4950, 8gb+ RAM [E1]. These parts aren’t top of the line but the cost of VR also includes the environment needed to run the VR. All interactive VR environments require controllers or input devices on top of the headset required to display the image to the user [E2]. 

--------------------------------------

Future: 
  Using the current requirements and specs of technology in a mobile phone can we determine if in 27 years VR will be possible with only a headset that contains the computing power?
Specs requried to run Virtual Reality on a desktop currently:
* The base clock speed for the gtx 970 is around 1050MHz[E3]
* The base clock speed for the i5-4950 is 3.3GHz [E4]
* 8 GBs of RAM needed

Compared to current smartphone technology:

* Current phones have around 1.8-2Ghz processor speed [E5]
* Many phones have 4GBs of RAM [E5]
* Currently smart phones don’t use dedicated graphics cards and instead use on board chips such as the Adreno 530 found in many high end android phones, and it has a processing clock speed around 650 MHz [E6].

Visual shows that yes in 27 years we will definitely have the technology to run VR on headsets with computational power built in based on current specs and the trend of technology growth into the future.

### Cost:
Current: Nvidia estimates that 99% of computers in 2016 couldn’t run VR programs [E10]. Therefore a VR setup currently costs $600-800 for the VR equipment and another $1000-2000 for the computer that can run the VR programs [E7]. The range of the computer is from $1000 which are the minimum requirements and up to $2000 for a computer with recommended requirements [E7]. This means the buy in for VR is around $1700 dollars for entry level, and with evolving program requirements it would be much safer to buy in at $2700. 
    The median household income of a U.S. family is $59,000 [E8]. So comparing the cost of a VR setup to a household income the calculated cost of a VR setup is 4.5% of a U.S. family income. Conclusively VR is currently too expensive to be a widespread technology.

----------------------------
Future: 
Looking at graph [E9] it's obvious that the cost of personal computers and peripherals has been on the decline. This means that following this trend in 27 years in the future these products will be very cheap [E9]. As more and more companies start to develop VR technology the cost has continually gone down, now consumers may use their smartphone instead of a computer, this means the VR quality is lower but the fact remains the VR buy in is cheaper [E10].

Using these sources it is possible that in the future families of all income level may afford VR as seen in Ready Player One. There is ample evidence that the cost of VR will continually decline until 2045, with no evidence against it currently. Unless an unforeseen trend in increasing technology cost occurs, almost every consumer in the near future will be able to afford a VR setup.


  - ### Facial Scanning
    - iPhone X implemented facial recognition and scanning, but the current technology is not as precise as in the movie. Current technology limitations include having a hard time differentiating children's faces and family members[2]. However this technology is improving fast using machine learning.

  - ### Virtual Currency
    - Exists in many apps and games in the form of in-game currency and used for in-game purchases, directly connected to real world money, money is used to purchase the in-game currency through a store.
    - Due to the world-wide use of the in-game currency, the movie’s virtual currency could resemble today’s cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are based on block-chain technology and use cryptography to ensure fairness in the system[3]. Cryptocurrencies have a value in real world dollars, but most are not able to be converted directly.

  - ### VR MMO
    - Communities of VR users have been a phenomenon since 2017 as seen in games such as VRChat. VR communities are in their early stages but many players are joining them and creating their own persona online. VR MMOs are currently gated behind having a strong PC to play as they require a decent amount of processing power[4].

## Future
 - ### Complete VR Immersion
    - Complete VR Immersion is currently being researched and developed by many VR companies attempting to overcome the weaknesses of VR. Currently many forms of VR are extremely limiting in what the user can do based on current technology restraints, but many researchers are starting to look at ways to improve how current VR technology is used. Using newer ideas with exsisting technology, such as force extension, and object impersonation [5]. Force extension will allow users to interact with objects based on force of gesture, creating a more realistic environment and object impersonation allows for users to interact with specific objects in a cluttered space by dissociating user into other object frames.
    
 - ### Control Technology with Mind
    - There are currently prosthetics that can be controlled using signals from the brain, but the current state of the technology is far from the state of control in *Ready Player One*

## Emerging
 - ### Control Technology with Mind
    - Omni-Directional Treadmill
 - ### Virtual Reality Headset with Computing Power
    - Current VR technology uses headsets that connect to a desktop to process the VR
    - Other VR headsets allow for a phone to be used in a VR headset, but the computing power is limited and far weaker than shown in the movie
 - ### Emotion Detection
    - Microsoft has created an Emotion API to read emotion, but it is still in development
 - ### Haptic Feedback
    - Startup company HaptX has created a prototype that contains hundreds of pressurized pockets of air to simulate feeling in VR
 - ### Casual Drone Deliveries
    - Amazon is developing drone technology to be used for prime deliveries
    
## Impossible
 - ### Amount of Copyright Licenses Used to Create Worlds, Avatars, Items, etc.
 - ### Hyper-realistic 3D Memory Segments from Past Videos, Documents, etc.

# Topics Covered
## Networked Communications - Ch.3
Let's talk...
## Intellectual Property - Ch.4
If a user creates something in the OASIS, do they own that or does the OASIS own it. Do users own their avatars?? If so, what if they are knockoffs of copyrighted characters or universes? People paid for their services and creations within the OASIS. H makes money off repairing and building items.
## Information Property - Ch.5
Players preserve their identity in the OASIS by using aliases. Information only gets out if people reveal their identity. Wade reveals his real name putting him and his family in danger. Someone was tracked easily by first name without government resources.
## Privacy and the Government - Ch.6
This chapter is not relevant to the movie because the movie doesn’t focus or spend time on how the government works and its relation to OASIS.
## Computer and Network Security - Ch.7
The virtual currencies in the movie could be stolen if the server operating OASIS was attacked. A security flaw in OASIS log off protocol allowed for “hackers” to prevent users from logging off. OASIS only uses 1 factor authentication allowing for susceptibility and account loss.
## Computer Reliability - Ch.8
Let's talk...
## Work and Wealth - Ch.10

# Plot Time Line
### Pre-2040 
The world is in shambles and people seek escape in the OASIS, a Massively Multiplayer Online Simulation Game (MMOSG), created by James Halliday and Ogden Marrow of Gregarious Games.
### 2040   
James Halliday, co-creator of the OASIS passes away. After his death, Halliday’s in-game avatar Anaorak announces a quest to find the Golden Easter Egg by acquiring 3 hidden keys spread throughout the OASIS universe. Once a player obtains the Golden Easter Egg, the player will be given ownership of the OASIS. OASIS players and Innovative Online Industries (IOI), a powerful technology corporation, rush to find the keys to obtain control of the OASIS. 
### 2045
Orphaned teenager Wade Watts, also known as Parzival in the OASIS, befriends Art3mis, a well-known Gunter (short for egg hunter), and they explore the Archives to find out information about Halliday’s life in the hope of finding the first key.

By driving backwards in the ever-shifting Manhattan cityscape racing mini game, Wade Watts and his friends obtain the first key. His crew becomes known as the High Fivers and consists of Parival, Art3mis, Aech, Daito, and Sho.

After learning of Halliday’s several regrets in life including his love for his friend Marrow’s wife Kira, Watts and his crew travel to a recreation of the movie *The Shining* and find the second key.

Nolan Sorrento, CEO of IOI, hires a mercenary i-R0k to find the identity of Watts and offers Watts an important job at IOI. When Watts refuses the position, Sorrento bombs Watts home, killing Watts’ aunt. Art3mis, in real life, saves Watts, but is captured soon after by IOI and put into a servitude chamber.

IOI discovers that the final key is found playing Halliday’s favorite Atari 2600 game on Planet Doom. In an effort to stop anyone from disrupting their operations, IOI protects the location with a force field. To stop IOI from obtaining the final key, Watts and his crew free Art3mis from the IOI facility and recruit OASIS players to fight against IOI.

Art3mis deactivates the force field and as a last line of defense Sorrento activates a virtual bomb that kills all player avatars on Planet Doom. Because of a special coin that Watts obtained earlier from the Archive Collector who is secretly Morrow’s avatar, Watts regenerates, completes the final challenge, and is awarded the 3rd key.

Watts is taken to a special virtual room and given a contract to sign by Anorak. The contract is the exact same contract that Morrow signed to turn over his share of Gregarious games, and since Watts is aware of the contract’s significance, he refuses to sign the contract. As a result of Watts’ wise decision, Anorak transforms into James Halliday, and Halliday graciously gives Watts the Golden Easter Egg and control over the OASIS.

### Post-Egg
Sorrento is arrested for bombing Watts’ house and murdering his aunt.

Watts bans IOI from forcing people into servitude and shuts down the OASIS twice a week to encourage people to live life in the real world.

Watts and Samantha Cook (Art3mis in real life) move in together.
